// Environment-specific styles.  These are almost always a bad idea.  Document what you're doing.

// With our styles, capybara-screenshot shows the page with the bare minimum height of something
// like 200px, not enough to see anything.  This forces it to use a taller height.
.env-test .wrap {
  min-height: 800px;
}

// Also set the width to a fixed value.  The default width is too narrow and pushes the toolbar buttons
// down, causing some specs to fail because of capybara-webkit issues with element stacking
.env-test {
  width: 1200px;
}
