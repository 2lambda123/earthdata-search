        research. Generally there are several GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit
        at any one time viewing different earth locations including the GOES-15 launched
        4 March 2010. The radiometer aboard the satellite, The GOES N-P Imager, is
        a five channel (one visible, four infrared) imaging radiometer designed to
        sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sampled areas of the earth.
        The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east
        along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system retuning
        telemetry in 10-bit precision. For this Group for High Resolution Sea Surface
        Temperature (GHRSST) dataset, skin sea surface temperature (SST) measurements
        are calculated from the far IR channels of GOES-15 at full resolution on a
        half hourly basis. In native satellite projection, vertically adjacent pixels
        are averaged and read out at every pixel. L2P datasets including Single Sensor
        Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST Data Processing

        Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a scientific instrument
        (radiometer) launched by NASA in 2002 on board the Aqua satellite platform
        (a second series is on the Terra platform) to study global dynamics of the
        Earths atmosphere, land and oceans. MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands
        ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions
        (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface
        temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and
        12 um spectrum are used. The Aqua platform is in a sun synchronous, near polar
        orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire Earth
        every 1 to 2 days. The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part of the
        Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) is a joint collaboration
        between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean Biology Processing
        Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science
        (RSMAS). RSMAS is responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm development,
        error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG is NASA ground data
        system for production of daily MODIS ocean products in HDF file format. JPL
        acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG in near realtime and reformats
        them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata. Data consists
        of global coverage at 1 km resolution with approximately 300+ five minute
        observation granules per day. For nighttime data both SST from the 11-12 um,
        and 4 um bands are available. Ocean chlorophyll a and K490 diffuse attenuation
        coefficient data are also available for daytime periods as non standard L2P

        Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a scientific instrument
        (radiometer) launched by NASA in 1999 on board the Terra satellite platform
        (a second series is on the Aqua platform) to study global dynamics of the
        Earths atmosphere, land and oceans. MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands
        ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions
        (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface
        temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and
        12 um spectrum are used. The Terra platform is in a sun synchronous, near
        polar orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire
        Earth every 1 to 2 days. The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part
        of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) is a joint
        collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean
        Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
        Science (RSMAS). RSMAS is responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm
        development, error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG is NASA
        ground data system for production of daily MODIS ocean products in HDF file
        format. JPL acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG in near realtime and
        reformats them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata.
        Data consists of global coverage at 1 km resolution with approximately 300+
        five minute observation granules per day. For nighttime data both SST from
        the 11-12 um, and 4 um bands are available. Ocean chlorophyll a and K490 diffuse
        attenuation coefficient data are also available for daytime periods as non

        using NOAA heritage Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system
        at the native sensor resolution. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer
        which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard
        of 112.56 degrees, using 16 detectors and double-side mirror assembly. At
        a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily
        coverage both in the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral
        bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate
        resolution bands (M-bands). In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor
        geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs
        are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns),
        and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns)
        bands, used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are in netcdf4 format
        compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). Each output
        file (granule) contains 10 minutes of data. In each valid water pixel (defined
        as ocean, sea, lake or river, up to 5 km inland; fill values are reported
        in invalid pixels, at \u003e5 km inland), the following layers are reported,
        among others: BTs in M12, 15, and 16 (original radiances are included for
        those users interested in direct radiance assimilation, e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA
        GMAO); SSTs derived from BTs using multi-channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear
        SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014); and ACSPO clear-sky mask
        (ACSM; provided in each pixel as part of l2p_flags) (Petrenko et al., 2010).
        We only recommend using the ACSM confidently clear pixels (equivalent to GDS2
        quality level=5, also reported for each pixel). The ACSM also provides day/night,
        land, ice, twilight, and glint flags. Note that users of ACSPO data have the

        and SSTs in those pixels. They may also ignore ACSPO SST, and derive their
        own SST from the original BTs. ACSPO VIIRS products are monitored and validated

        Computer Atlas of the Newfoundland Basin and Labrador Sea was\n      designed
        to make simple, fast and reliable access to large volumes of\n      historical
        and real time oceanographic data. The choice of the Newfoundland\n      Basin
        and Labrador Sea was motivated by their importance in the entire North\n      Atlantic
        circulation and water mass formation, the existence of various water\n      masses
        and sharp fronts, indications of significant temporal and spatial\n      changes
        in the water mass properties, intense air-sea interaction and dense\n      coverage
        with oceanographic data of various types.\n      \n               The Atlas
        operates with different types of oceanographic data:\n      conductivity-temperature-depth
        (CTD), water bottle, expendable bathythermograph\n      (XBT), current meter,
        floats, etc. The sources of the data are: - Bedford\n      Institute of Oceanography
        (BIO) cruises, - World Ocean Circulation Experiment\n      (WOCE) cruises,
        - Russian SECTIONS program carried by State Oceanographic\n      Institute,
        and P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology (SOI, PPS, Moscow,\n      Russia),\n      -
        Obninsk World Data Center (WDC, Obninsk, Russia), - NOAA National\n      Oceanographic
        Data Center (NODC, Washington, USA), - Marine Environmental Data\n      Service
        (MEDS, Ottawa, Canada).\n      \n               The Atlas integrates the advantages
        of databases and paper atlases,\n      allowing the user to solve complex
        tasks (such as, T-S or time series analysis\n      for specified regions,
        sections or points) in a simple way avoiding complex\n      queries for data
        and algorithms. It performs data selection, processing,\n      analysis and
        visualization in different oceanographic coordinates. The Atlas\n      locates
        data from a simple query, produces plots (field, section, etc.), and\n      runs
        different statistical and oceanographic applications. It offers an\n      optional
        selection of procedures for objective analysis, interpolation,\n      averaging,
        smoothing and subsampling of data and results. Scale-independence is\n      one
        of its features, allowing users to work on different spatial and temporal\n      scales,
        and adjust the working environment for their own needs and\n      requirements.
        Users can easily load other data sets, change regions and attach\n      their
        own procedures.\n      \n               The Atlas has been used for data analysis,
        preparation of fields to\n      initialize hydrodynamic models and various

        research. Generally there are several GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit
        at any one time viewing different earth locations including the GOES-15 launched
        4 March 2010. The radiometer aboard the satellite, The GOES N-P Imager, is
        a five channel (one visible, four infrared) imaging radiometer designed to
        sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sampled areas of the earth.
        The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east
        along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system retuning
        telemetry in 10-bit precision. For this Group for High Resolution Sea Surface
        Temperature (GHRSST) dataset, skin sea surface temperature (SST) measurements
        are calculated from the far IR channels of GOES-15 at full resolution on a
        half hourly basis. In native satellite projection, vertically adjacent pixels
        are averaged and read out at every pixel. L2P datasets including Single Sensor
        Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST Data Processing

        2011, is the new generation of the US Polar Operational Environmental Satellites
        (POES). As during the POES era, NOAA is responsible for all JPSS products,
        including Level 2 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) SST derived
        using NOAA heritage Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system
        at the native sensor resolution. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer
        which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard
        of 112.56 degrees, using 16 detectors and double-side mirror assembly. At
        a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily
        coverage both in the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral
        bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate
        resolution bands (M-bands). In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor
        geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs
        are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns),
        and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns)
        bands, used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are in netcdf4 format
        compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). Each output
        file (granule) contains 10 minutes of data. In each valid water pixel (defined
        as ocean, sea, lake or river, up to 5 km inland; fill values are reported
        in invalid pixels, at \u003e5 km inland), the following layers are reported,
        among others: BTs in M12, 15, and 16 (original radiances are included for
        those users interested in direct radiance assimilation, e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA
        GMAO); SSTs derived from BTs using multi-channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear
        SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014); and ACSPO clear-sky mask
        (ACSM; provided in each pixel as part of l2p_flags) (Petrenko et al., 2010).
        We only recommend using the ACSM confidently clear pixels (equivalent to GDS2
        quality level=5, also reported for each pixel). The ACSM also provides day/night,
        land, ice, twilight, and glint flags. Note that users of ACSPO data have the
        flexibility to ignore the ACSM, derive their own clear-sky mask, and use BTs
        and SSTs in those pixels. They may also ignore ACSPO SST, and derive their
        own SST from the original BTs. ACSPO VIIRS products are monitored and validated
        against in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010) and
        MICROS (Liang and Ignatov, 2011).\n","has_granules":false,"orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1224519979-NOAA_NCEI","original_format":"DIF","granule_count":0,"browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","title":"\nThese

        Transport Satellites (MTSAT) are a series of geostationary weather satellites

        mission to assist air navigation, plus a meteorological mission to provide
        imagery over the Asia-Pacific region for the hemisphere centered on 140 East.
        The meteorological mission includes an imager giving nominal hourly full Earth
        disk images in five spectral bands (one visible, four infrared). MTSAT are
        spin stabilized satellites. With this system images are built up by scanning
        with a mirror that is tilted in small successive steps from the north pole
        to south pole at a rate such that on each rotation of the satellite an adjacent
        strip of the Earth is scanned. It takes about 25 minutes to scan the full
        Earth''s disk. This builds a picture 10,000 pixels for the visible images
        (1.25 km resolution) and 2,500 pixels (4 km resolution) for the infrared images.

        to make simple, fast and reliable access to large volumes of\n      historical
        and real time oceanographic data. The choice of the Newfoundland\n      Basin
        and Labrador Sea was motivated by their importance in the entire North\n      Atlantic
        circulation and water mass formation, the existence of various water\n      masses
        and sharp fronts, indications of significant temporal and spatial\n      changes
        in the water mass properties, intense air-sea interaction and dense\n      coverage
        with oceanographic data of various types.\n      \n               The Atlas
        operates with different types of oceanographic data:\n      conductivity-temperature-depth
        (CTD), water bottle, expendable bathythermograph\n      (XBT), current meter,
        floats, etc. The sources of the data are: - Bedford\n      Institute of Oceanography
        (BIO) cruises, - World Ocean Circulation Experiment\n      (WOCE) cruises,
        - Russian SECTIONS program carried by State Oceanographic\n      Institute,
        and P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology (SOI, PPS, Moscow,\n      Russia),\n      -
        Obninsk World Data Center (WDC, Obninsk, Russia), - NOAA National\n      Oceanographic
        Data Center (NODC, Washington, USA), - Marine Environmental Data\n      Service
        (MEDS, Ottawa, Canada).\n      \n               The Atlas integrates the advantages
        of databases and paper atlases,\n      allowing the user to solve complex
        tasks (such as, T-S or time series analysis\n      for specified regions,
        sections or points) in a simple way avoiding complex\n      queries for data
        and algorithms. It performs data selection, processing,\n      analysis and
        visualization in different oceanographic coordinates. The Atlas\n      locates
        data from a simple query, produces plots (field, section, etc.), and\n      runs
        different statistical and oceanographic applications. It offers an\n      optional
        selection of procedures for objective analysis, interpolation,\n      averaging,
        smoothing and subsampling of data and results. Scale-independence is\n      one
        of its features, allowing users to work on different spatial and temporal\n      scales,
        and adjust the working environment for their own needs and\n      requirements.
        Users can easily load other data sets, change regions and attach\n      their
        own procedures.\n      \n               The Atlas has been used for data analysis,
