        Top Altitude\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  Channels 1 and 2 have 250 m resolution,
        channels 3 through 7 have 500\t\t\t\t\t  m resolution, and the rest have 1
        km resolution. However, for the\t\t\t\t\t  MODIS L1B 1 km product, the 250
        m and 500 m band radiance data and\t\t\t\t\t  their associated uncertainties
        have been aggregated to 1 km\t\t\t\t\t  resolution. Thus the entire channel
        data set is referenced to the same\t\t\t\t\t  spatial and geolocation scales.
        Separate L1B products are available\t\t\t\t\t  for the 250 m channels (MOD02QKM)
        and 500 m channels (MOD02HKM) that\t\t\t\t\t  preserve the original resolution
        of the data.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir
        is 1 km, degrading to 4.8 km in\t\t\t\t\t  the along-scan direction at the
        scan extremes. However, thanks to the\t\t\t\t\t  overlapping of consecutive
        swaths and respectively pixels there, the\t\t\t\t\t  resulting resolution
        at the scan extremes is about 2 km.  A 55 degree\t\t\t\t\t  scanning pattern
        at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km\t\t\t\t\t  orbital swath width
        and provides global coverage every one to two\t\t\t\t\t  days. A single MODIS
        Level 1B granule will nominally contain a scene\t\t\t\t\t  built from 203
        scans (or swaths) sampled 1354 times in the cross-track\t\t\t\t\t  direction,
        corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data.\t\t\t\t\t  Since an
        individual MODIS scan (or swath) will contain 10 along-track\t\t\t\t\t  spatial
        elements, the scene will be composed of (1354 x 2030) pixels,\t\t\t\t\t  resulting
        in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2030 km).Due to the\t\t\t\t\t  MODIS scan
        geometry, there will be increasing overlap occurring beyond\t\t\t\t\t  about
        25 degrees scan angle.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  To summarize, the MODIS L1B
        1 km data product consists of:\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  1. Calibrated radiances
        and uncertainties for (2) 250 m reflected\t\t\t\t\t  solar bands aggregated
        to 1 km resolution\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties
        for (5) 500 m reflected\t\t\t\t\t  solar bands aggregated to 1 km resolution\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  3.
        Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (13) 1 km reflected\t\t\t\t\t  solar
        bands and (16) infrared emissive bands\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  4. Geolocation

        from LAADS.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  The MODIS L1B data are stored in the Earth
        Observing System\t\t\t\t\t  Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS) which is an
        extension of HDF as\t\t\t\t\t  developed by the National Center for Supercomputer
        Applications (NCSA)\t\t\t\t\t  at the University of Illinois. A typical file
        size will be\t\t\t\t\t  approximately 260 MB.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  Environmental
        information derived from MODIS L1B measurements will\t\t\t\t\t  offer a comprehensive
        and unprecedented look at terrestrial,\t\t\t\t\t  atmospheric, and ocean phenomenology
        for a wide and diverse community\t\t\t\t\t  of users throughout the world.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  (The
        Shortname for this product is MOD021KM)\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  The V004 Program
        Executable (PGE), for MODIS Level 1B products, has\t\t\t\t\t  gone through
        a series of revisions since the initial release of V4.0.0\t\t\t\t\t  in March
        of 2002. These include revisions to make it\t\t\t\t\t  LINUX-compatible. The
        current version is V4.0.9, which does not\t\t\t\t\t  contain changes to the
        code that affect scientific output.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  Below is a brief
        overview of changes that affect scientific output in\t\t\t\t\t  previous versions
        (V4.0.0 to V4.0.7) of PGE code. The MCST web site,\t\t\t\t\t  listed in the
        URL section of this DIF, has a more detailed version of\t\t\t\t\t  this information,
        including revisions that do not affect scientific\t\t\t\t\t  output.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  Significant
        changes to Look Up Tables (LUT) used in Level 1B\t\t\t\t\t  processing have
        occurred. These include revising the\t\t\t\t\t  Response-versus-Scan Angle
        (RVS) LUTs from listing the RVS corrections\t\t\t\t\t  to listing the quadratic
        coefficients used in making the RVS\t\t\t\t\t  correction. The coefficients
        are now calculated by interpolating on\t\t\t\t\t  the granule collection time
        and the RVS corrections are then generated\t\t\t\t\t  using the interpolated
        coefficients. Previously used Emissive and\t\t\t\t\t  Reflective RVS LUT tables
        were eliminated and new ones introduced.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  An incorrect
        comparison between RVS coefficients for Thermal\t\t\t\t\t  Emissivity Bands
        (TEB) and Reflective Solar Bands (RSB) was being made\t\t\t\t\t  during the
        calculation of the RVS coefficients. This was replaced with\t\t\t\t\t  a comparison
        between TEB coefficients.  This error never resulted in\t\t\t\t\t  an incorrect
        RVS correction but did lead to re-calculating the\t\t\t\t\t  coefficients
        for each detector in a thermal band even if the\t\t\t\t\t  coefficients were
        the same for all 10 detectors.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  A destriping algorithm
        for Band 26 devised by C. Moeller was\t\t\t\t\t  implemented. A new time-dependent
        LUT was added which gives\t\t\t\t\t  coefficients for a detector-specific
        cross-talk correction based on\t\t\t\t\t  the aggregated Band 5 radiances.  The
        Band 26 scaled integers are\t\t\t\t\t  adjusted by the Band 5 correction term,
        which is the product of the\t\t\t\t\t  Band 5 radiance times the ratio of
        the Band 5 to Band 26 scaling\t\t\t\t\t  factors times the LUT correction
        value for that detector.  In addition\t\t\t\t\t  a new LUT which allows for
        a frame offset with regard to the Band 5\t\t\t\t\t  radiance was added.  A
        LUT which switches the correction off or on was\t\t\t\t\t  also added.\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  Data

        Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a scientific instrument
        (radiometer) launched by NASA in 2002 on board the Aqua satellite platform
        (a second series is on the Terra platform) to study global dynamics of the
        Earths atmosphere, land and oceans. MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands
        ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions
        (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface
        temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and
        12 um spectrum are used. The Aqua platform is in a sun synchronous, near polar
        orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire Earth
        every 1 to 2 days. The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part of the

        between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean Biology Processing

        Polar Satellite System (JPSS), starting with S-NPP launched on 28 October
        2011, is the new generation of the US Polar Operational Environmental Satellites
        (POES). As during the POES era, NOAA is responsible for all JPSS products,
        including Level 2 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) SST derived
        using NOAA heritage Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system
        at the native sensor resolution. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer
        which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard
        of 112.56 degrees, using 16 detectors and double-side mirror assembly. At
        a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily
        coverage both in the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral
        bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate
        resolution bands (M-bands). In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor
        geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs
        are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns),
        and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns)
        bands, used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are in netcdf4 format
        compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). Each output
        file (granule) contains 10 minutes of data. In each valid water pixel (defined
        as ocean, sea, lake or river, up to 5 km inland; fill values are reported
        in invalid pixels, at \u003e5 km inland), the following layers are reported,
        among others: BTs in M12, 15, and 16 (original radiances are included for
        those users interested in direct radiance assimilation, e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA
        GMAO); SSTs derived from BTs using multi-channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear
        SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014); and ACSPO clear-sky mask
        (ACSM; provided in each pixel as part of l2p_flags) (Petrenko et al., 2010).
        We only recommend using the ACSM confidently clear pixels (equivalent to GDS2
        quality level=5, also reported for each pixel). The ACSM also provides day/night,
        land, ice, twilight, and glint flags. Note that users of ACSPO data have the
        flexibility to ignore the ACSM, derive their own clear-sky mask, and use BTs
        and SSTs in those pixels. They may also ignore ACSPO SST, and derive their
        own SST from the original BTs. ACSPO VIIRS products are monitored and validated
        against in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010) and
        MICROS (Liang and Ignatov, 2011).\n","has_granules":false,"orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1224519979-NOAA_NCEI","original_format":"DIF","granule_count":0,"browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","title":"\nThese

        Set Description web page, which may be found at\nthe following URL: \"http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/data/landcover/index.shtml\".\n      \n      To
        develop improved methodologies for global land cover\n      classifications
        as well as to provide global land cover products for immediate use in global
        change research, University of Maryland''s\n      Global Land Cover Facility
        (GLCF) and NASA have employed the\n      NASA/NOAA Pathfinder Land (PAL) data
        set with a spatial resolution of 1km. This data set has a length of record
        of 14 years (1981-1994),\n      providing the ability to test the stability
        of classification\n      algorithms. Furthermore, this data set includes red,
        infrared, and\n      thermal bands in addition to the Normalized Difference
        Vegetation\n      Index (NDVI). Inclusion of these additional bands improves\n      discrimination
        between cover types.\n      \n      To identify the pixels to be used for
        training of the 1 km AVHRR\n      Pathfinder data, the investigators collected
        a total of over 200\n      high resolution scenes of which they were confident
        of which cover type\n      occurs.  Most of the scenes used were acquired
        by the Landsat\n      Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), and a few by Landsat
        Thematic\n      Mapper and the LISS (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor).\n      \n      Of
        the initial 200 scenes, the investigators considered 156 suitable for\n      interpretation.
        Scenes were considered unsuitable if haze or poor\n      quality data obscured
        the scene or if the cover types in the scene\n      could not be visually
        distinguished. For most scenes, the\n      investigators aimed to identify
        only one cover type within the\n      scene. It was possible, however, to
        identify more than one cover type\n      in some scenes if croplands were
        visually identifiable based on the\n      spatial patterns of fields or if
        vegetation maps showed the presence\n      of clearly identifiable cover types.\n      \n      The
        second part of the study involved deriving a global land cover\n      classififcation
        product. The product was derived by testing several\n      metrics that describe
        the temporal dynamics of vegetation over an\n      annual cycle. These metrics
        have the potential to be used as input\n      variables to a global land cover
        classification. The tested metrics\n      are based on 1) the ratio between
        surface temperature and NDVI, 2)\n      seasonal metrics derived from the
        NDVI temporal profile such as length\n      of growing season, 3) a rule-based
        approach that determines cover type\n      through a series of hierarchical
        trees based on surface temperature\n      and NDVI values, and 4) annual mean,
        maximum, minimum, and amplitude\n      values for all optical and thermal
        channels in the AVHRR Pathfinder\n      Land (PAL) data. These metrics were
        applied to 1984 PAL data at 8km\n      resolution to derive a global land
        cover classification product using\n      a decision tree classifier. This
        method was then applied to AVHRR\n      data from other years and higher spatial
        resolutions.","has_granules":false,"time_end":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1214608509-SCIOPS","original_format":"DIF","granule_count":0,"browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","title":"1

        climate information at multicentennial timescales that may not be\ncaptured
        by tree-ring data. Here we reconstruct Northern Hemisphere\ntemperatures for
        the past 2,000 years by combining low-resolution proxies with\ntree-ring data,
        using a wavelet transform technique to achieve\ntimescale-dependent processing
        of the data. Our reconstruction shows larger\nmulticentennial variability
        than most previous multi-proxy reconstructions, but\nagrees well with temperatures
        reconstructed from borehole measurements and with\ntemperatures obtained with
        a general circulation model. According to our\nreconstruction, high temperatures
        - similar to those observed in the twentieth\ncentury before 1990- occurred
        around AD 1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures\nthat are about 0.7K below
        the average of 1961-90 occurred around AD 1600. This\nlarge natural variability
        in the past suggests an important role of natural\nmulticentennial variability
        that is likely to continue.\n\nThis data set consists of reconstructed Northern
        Hemisphere temperatures for\nthe past 2,000 years  calculated by combining
        low-resolution proxies with\ntree-ring data,  using a wavelet transform technique
        to achieve\ntimescale-dependent  processing of the data.\n\nAll data are given
        as temperature anomalies (K) from the Northern Hemisphere\nannual mean  temperature

        Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a scientific instrument
        (radiometer) launched by NASA in 2002 on board the Aqua satellite platform
        (a second series is on the Terra platform) to study global dynamics of the
        Earths atmosphere, land and oceans. MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands
        ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions
        (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface
        temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and
        12 um spectrum are used. The Aqua platform is in a sun synchronous, near polar
        orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire Earth
        every 1 to 2 days. The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part of the
        Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) is a joint collaboration
        between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean Biology Processing
        Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science
        (RSMAS). RSMAS is responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm development,
        error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG is NASA ground data
        system for production of daily MODIS ocean products in HDF file format. JPL
        acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG in near realtime and reformats
        them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata. Data consists

        Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a scientific instrument
        (radiometer) launched by NASA in 1999 on board the Terra satellite platform
        (a second series is on the Aqua platform) to study global dynamics of the
        Earths atmosphere, land and oceans. MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands
        ranging in wavelength from 0.4 um to 14.4 um and at varying spatial resolutions
        (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). For the sea surface
        temperature (SST) products from this radiometer channels in the 4, 11 and
        12 um spectrum are used. The Terra platform is in a sun synchronous, near
        polar orbit at 705 km altitude and the MODIS instrument images the entire
        Earth every 1 to 2 days. The production of the MODIS L2P SST data as part
        of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) is a joint
        collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the NASA Ocean
        Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
        Science (RSMAS). RSMAS is responsible for sea surface temperature algorithm
        development, error statistics and quality flagging, while the OBPG is NASA
        ground data system for production of daily MODIS ocean products in HDF file
        format. JPL acquires MODIS ocean granules from the OBPG in near realtime and
        reformats them to the GHRSST L2P netCDF specification with complete metadata.
        Data consists of global coverage at 1 km resolution with approximately 300+
        five minute observation granules per day. For nighttime data both SST from

        Polar Satellite System (JPSS), starting with S-NPP launched on 28 October
        2011, is the new generation of the US Polar Operational Environmental Satellites
        (POES). As during the POES era, NOAA is responsible for all JPSS products,
        including Level 2 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) SST derived
        using NOAA heritage Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system
        at the native sensor resolution. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer
        which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard
        of 112.56 degrees, using 16 detectors and double-side mirror assembly. At
        a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily
        coverage both in the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral
        bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate
        resolution bands (M-bands). In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor
        geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs
        are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns),
        and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns)
        bands, used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are in netcdf4 format
        compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). Each output
        file (granule) contains 10 minutes of data. In each valid water pixel (defined
        as ocean, sea, lake or river, up to 5 km inland; fill values are reported
        in invalid pixels, at \u003e5 km inland), the following layers are reported,
        among others: BTs in M12, 15, and 16 (original radiances are included for
        those users interested in direct radiance assimilation, e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA
        GMAO); SSTs derived from BTs using multi-channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear
        SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014); and ACSPO clear-sky mask
        (ACSM; provided in each pixel as part of l2p_flags) (Petrenko et al., 2010).
        We only recommend using the ACSM confidently clear pixels (equivalent to GDS2
        quality level=5, also reported for each pixel). The ACSM also provides day/night,
        land, ice, twilight, and glint flags. Note that users of ACSPO data have the
        flexibility to ignore the ACSM, derive their own clear-sky mask, and use BTs
        and SSTs in those pixels. They may also ignore ACSPO SST, and derive their
        own SST from the original BTs. ACSPO VIIRS products are monitored and validated
        against in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010) and

        by the Landsat\n      Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), and a few by Landsat
        Thematic\n      Mapper and the LISS (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor).\n      \n      Of
        the initial 200 scenes, the investigators considered 156 suitable for\n      interpretation.
        Scenes were considered unsuitable if haze or poor\n      quality data obscured
        the scene or if the cover types in the scene\n      could not be visually
        distinguished. For most scenes, the\n      investigators aimed to identify
        only one cover type within the\n      scene. It was possible, however, to
        identify more than one cover type\n      in some scenes if croplands were
        visually identifiable based on the\n      spatial patterns of fields or if
        vegetation maps showed the presence\n      of clearly identifiable cover types.\n      \n      The
        second part of the study involved deriving a global land cover\n      classififcation
        product. The product was derived by testing several\n      metrics that describe
        the temporal dynamics of vegetation over an\n      annual cycle. These metrics
        have the potential to be used as input\n      variables to a global land cover
        classification. The tested metrics\n      are based on 1) the ratio between
        surface temperature and NDVI, 2)\n      seasonal metrics derived from the
        NDVI temporal profile such as length\n      of growing season, 3) a rule-based
        approach that determines cover type\n      through a series of hierarchical
        trees based on surface temperature\n      and NDVI values, and 4) annual mean,
        maximum, minimum, and amplitude\n      values for all optical and thermal
        channels in the AVHRR Pathfinder\n      Land (PAL) data. These metrics were
        applied to 1984 PAL data at 8km\n      resolution to derive a global land
        cover classification product using\n      a decision tree classifier. This
        method was then applied to AVHRR\n      data from other years and higher spatial
        resolutions.","has_granules":false,"time_end":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1214608509-SCIOPS","original_format":"DIF","granule_count":0,"browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","title":"1

        number of reconstructions of millennial-scale climate variability have been\ncarried
        out in order to understand patterns of natural climate variability, on\ndecade
        to century timescales, and the role of anthropogenic forcing. These\nreconstructions
        have mainly used tree-ring data and other data sets of annual\nto decadal
        resolution. Lake and ocean sediments have a lower time resolution,\nbut provide
        climate information at multicentennial timescales that may not be\ncaptured
        by tree-ring data. Here we reconstruct Northern Hemisphere\ntemperatures for
        the past 2,000 years by combining low-resolution proxies with\ntree-ring data,
        using a wavelet transform technique to achieve\ntimescale-dependent processing
        of the data. Our reconstruction shows larger\nmulticentennial variability
        than most previous multi-proxy reconstructions, but\nagrees well with temperatures
        reconstructed from borehole measurements and with\ntemperatures obtained with
        a general circulation model. According to our\nreconstruction, high temperatures
        - similar to those observed in the twentieth\ncentury before 1990- occurred
        around AD 1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures\nthat are about 0.7K below

        countries that measures the overall progress towards environmental sustainability.
        The index is a composite measure of the current status of a nation''s environmental
        systems, \n\npressures on those systems, human vulnerability to environmental
        change, national capacity to respond, and contributions to global environmental
        stewardship. The refinements included the \n\naddition and deletion of indicators,
        filling gaps in data coverage, new data sets, and the modification of the
        aggregation scheme. The index was unveiled at the World Economic Forum''s
        \n\nannual meeting, January 2001, Davos, Switzerland. The 2001 ESI is the
        result of collaboration among the World Economic Forum (WEF), Yale Center
        for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), \n\nand the Columbia University
        Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)","has_granules":false,"orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C1000000220-SEDAC","original_format":"ECHO10","granule_count":0,"archive_center":"SEDAC","browse_flag":false,"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","title":"data

        United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
        support weather forecasting, severe storm tracking, meteorology and oceanography
        research. Generally there are several GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit
        at any one time viewing different earth locations including the GOES-15 launched
        4 March 2010. The radiometer aboard the satellite, The GOES N-P Imager, is
        a five channel (one visible, four infrared) imaging radiometer designed to
        sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sampled areas of the earth.
        The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east
        along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system retuning
        telemetry in 10-bit precision. For this Group for High Resolution Sea Surface
        Temperature (GHRSST) dataset, skin sea surface temperature (SST) measurements
        are calculated from the far IR channels of GOES-15 at full resolution on a
        half hourly basis. In native satellite projection, vertically adjacent pixels
        are averaged and read out at every pixel. L2P datasets including Single Sensor
        Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST Data Processing
        Specification (GDS) version 2.0. The full disk image is subsetted into granules

        which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard
        of 112.56 degrees, using 16 detectors and double-side mirror assembly. At
        a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily
        coverage both in the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral
        bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate
        resolution bands (M-bands). In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor
        geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs
        are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns),
        and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns)
        bands, used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are in netcdf4 format
        compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). Each output
        file (granule) contains 10 minutes of data. In each valid water pixel (defined

        in invalid pixels, at \u003e5 km inland), the following layers are reported,

        Transport Satellites (MTSAT) are a series of geostationary weather satellites
        operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). MTSAT carries an aeronautical
        mission to assist air navigation, plus a meteorological mission to provide
        imagery over the Asia-Pacific region for the hemisphere centered on 140 East.
        The meteorological mission includes an imager giving nominal hourly full Earth
        disk images in five spectral bands (one visible, four infrared). MTSAT are
        spin stabilized satellites. With this system images are built up by scanning
        with a mirror that is tilted in small successive steps from the north pole
        to south pole at a rate such that on each rotation of the satellite an adjacent
        strip of the Earth is scanned. It takes about 25 minutes to scan the full
        Earth''s disk. This builds a picture 10,000 pixels for the visible images
        (1.25 km resolution) and 2,500 pixels (4 km resolution) for the infrared images.
        The MTSAT-2 (also known as Himawari 7) and it''s radiometer (MTSAT-2 Imager)
        was successfully launched on 18 February 2006. For this Group for High Resolution
        Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset, skin sea surface temperature (SST)
        measurements are calculated from the IR channels of the MTSAT-2 Imager full
        resolution data in satellite projection on a hourly basis by using Bayesian
        Cloud Mask algorithm at the Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO).
        L2P datasets including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived

        to make simple, fast and reliable access to large volumes of\n      historical
        and real time oceanographic data. The choice of the Newfoundland\n      Basin
        and Labrador Sea was motivated by their importance in the entire North\n      Atlantic
        circulation and water mass formation, the existence of various water\n      masses
        and sharp fronts, indications of significant temporal and spatial\n      changes
        in the water mass properties, intense air-sea interaction and dense\n      coverage
        with oceanographic data of various types.\n      \n               The Atlas
        operates with different types of oceanographic data:\n      conductivity-temperature-depth
        (CTD), water bottle, expendable bathythermograph\n      (XBT), current meter,
        floats, etc. The sources of the data are: - Bedford\n      Institute of Oceanography
        (BIO) cruises, - World Ocean Circulation Experiment\n      (WOCE) cruises,
        - Russian SECTIONS program carried by State Oceanographic\n      Institute,
        and P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology (SOI, PPS, Moscow,\n      Russia),\n      -
        Obninsk World Data Center (WDC, Obninsk, Russia), - NOAA National\n      Oceanographic
        Data Center (NODC, Washington, USA), - Marine Environmental Data\n      Service
        (MEDS, Ottawa, Canada).\n      \n               The Atlas integrates the advantages
        of databases and paper atlases,\n      allowing the user to solve complex
        tasks (such as, T-S or time series analysis\n      for specified regions,
        sections or points) in a simple way avoiding complex\n      queries for data
        and algorithms. It performs data selection, processing,\n      analysis and
        visualization in different oceanographic coordinates. The Atlas\n      locates
        data from a simple query, produces plots (field, section, etc.), and\n      runs
        different statistical and oceanographic applications. It offers an\n      optional
        selection of procedures for objective analysis, interpolation,\n      averaging,
        smoothing and subsampling of data and results. Scale-independence is\n      one
        of its features, allowing users to work on different spatial and temporal\n      scales,
        and adjust the working environment for their own needs and\n      requirements.
        Users can easily load other data sets, change regions and attach\n      their
        own procedures.\n      \n               The Atlas has been used for data analysis,
        preparation of fields to\n      initialize hydrodynamic models and various

        sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sampled areas of the earth.
        The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east
        along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system retuning
        telemetry in 10-bit precision. For this Group for High Resolution Sea Surface

        are calculated from the far IR channels of GOES-15 at full resolution on a

        Polar Satellite System (JPSS), starting with S-NPP launched on 28 October

        including Level 2 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) SST derived
        using NOAA heritage Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system
        at the native sensor resolution. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer
        which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of regard
        of 112.56 degrees, using 16 detectors and double-side mirror assembly. At
        a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3060 km, providing full daily
        coverage both in the day and night side of the Earth. VIIRS has 22 spectral
        bands covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 micrometers, including 16 moderate
        resolution bands (M-bands). In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-Sensor
        geometry, and ancillary data from NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO inputs
        are 3 brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7microns), M15 (11microns),
        and M16 (12microns), and 2 reflectances in M5 (0.67microns) and M7 (0.87microns)
        bands, used for cloud identification. ACSPO output files are in netcdf4 format
        compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). Each output
        file (granule) contains 10 minutes of data. In each valid water pixel (defined
        as ocean, sea, lake or river, up to 5 km inland; fill values are reported
        in invalid pixels, at \u003e5 km inland), the following layers are reported,
        among others: BTs in M12, 15, and 16 (original radiances are included for
        those users interested in direct radiance assimilation, e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA
        GMAO); SSTs derived from BTs using multi-channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear
        SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014); and ACSPO clear-sky mask
        (ACSM; provided in each pixel as part of l2p_flags) (Petrenko et al., 2010).
        We only recommend using the ACSM confidently clear pixels (equivalent to GDS2
        quality level=5, also reported for each pixel). The ACSM also provides day/night,
        land, ice, twilight, and glint flags. Note that users of ACSPO data have the
        flexibility to ignore the ACSM, derive their own clear-sky mask, and use BTs
        and SSTs in those pixels. They may also ignore ACSPO SST, and derive their
        own SST from the original BTs. ACSPO VIIRS products are monitored and validated
        against in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010) and

        Computer Atlas of the Newfoundland Basin and Labrador Sea was\n      designed
        to make simple, fast and reliable access to large volumes of\n      historical
        and real time oceanographic data. The choice of the Newfoundland\n      Basin
        and Labrador Sea was motivated by their importance in the entire North\n      Atlantic
        circulation and water mass formation, the existence of various water\n      masses
        and sharp fronts, indications of significant temporal and spatial\n      changes
        in the water mass properties, intense air-sea interaction and dense\n      coverage
        with oceanographic data of various types.\n      \n               The Atlas
        operates with different types of oceanographic data:\n      conductivity-temperature-depth
        (CTD), water bottle, expendable bathythermograph\n      (XBT), current meter,
        floats, etc. The sources of the data are: - Bedford\n      Institute of Oceanography
        (BIO) cruises, - World Ocean Circulation Experiment\n      (WOCE) cruises,
        - Russian SECTIONS program carried by State Oceanographic\n      Institute,
        and P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology (SOI, PPS, Moscow,\n      Russia),\n      -
        Obninsk World Data Center (WDC, Obninsk, Russia), - NOAA National\n      Oceanographic
        Data Center (NODC, Washington, USA), - Marine Environmental Data\n      Service
        (MEDS, Ottawa, Canada).\n      \n               The Atlas integrates the advantages
        of databases and paper atlases,\n      allowing the user to solve complex
        tasks (such as, T-S or time series analysis\n      for specified regions,
        sections or points) in a simple way avoiding complex\n      queries for data
        and algorithms. It performs data selection, processing,\n      analysis and
        visualization in different oceanographic coordinates. The Atlas\n      locates
        data from a simple query, produces plots (field, section, etc.), and\n      runs
        different statistical and oceanographic applications. It offers an\n      optional
        selection of procedures for objective analysis, interpolation,\n      averaging,
        smoothing and subsampling of data and results. Scale-independence is\n      one
        of its features, allowing users to work on different spatial and temporal\n      scales,
        and adjust the working environment for their own needs and\n      requirements.
        Users can easily load other data sets, change regions and attach\n      their
        own procedures.\n      \n               The Atlas has been used for data analysis,
        preparation of fields to\n      initialize hydrodynamic models and various
        comparisons of property\n      distributions based on ''real'' data and results

        on three priority levels of stratification, namely ecozones,\necoregions,
        and ecodistricts.  The resulting national report \"A National\nEcological
        Framework for Canada\" was released by the Ecological Stratification\nWorking
        Group in 1996.   This dataset is the product of that work, as well as\nthe

        provides a consistent, national\nspatial context within which ecosystems at
        various levels of generalization can\nbe described, monitored, and reported
        on. The use of such a framework of\nstandard ecological units provides for

        chased down thunderstorms using an uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) -\n                  allowing
        them to achieve dual goals of gathering weather data safely and\n                  testing
        new aircraft technology. This marked the first time a UAV was used to\n                  conduct
        lightning research.\n                  \n                  Aimed at better
        understanding the causes of an electrical storm''s fury and its\n                  effects
        on our home planet, this study was a collaboration among the Marshall\n                  Center;
        the University of Alabama at Huntsville; NASA''s Goddard Space Flight\n                  Center,

        Key West in Florida. ACES researchers in August 2002 conducted\n                  overflights
        of thunderstorms over the southwestern corner of Florida. For the\n                  first
        time in NASA research an uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) named ALTUS was\n                  used
        to collect cloud electrification data. Carrying field mills, optical\n                  sensors,
        electric field sensors and other instruments, it allowed scientists to\n                  collect
        cloud electrification data for the first time from above the storm from\n                  it''s
